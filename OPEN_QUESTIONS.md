## Physics / Algorithms

**Q1 — Joint friction (URDF `<dynamics friction="..."/>`)**
URDF joint friction is parsed and stored in `_URDFData` but not used.
True static/dynamic friction at the joint level requires a different model
from viscous damping (e.g., Coulomb friction with stiction zone).
- Current: parsed, silently ignored in `_build_model`
- Needed: decide model (Coulomb? LuGre?) and where it lives (joint or integrator)
- Blocking: nothing for now. Revisit in Phase 2.

**Q2 — Body velocity exposure from RobotTree**
`_compute_body_velocities()` in `simple_quadruped.py` duplicates the forward
pass already done inside `aba()`. `RobotTree` should expose a public
`body_velocities(q, qdot) -> list[Vec6]` method so contact and self-collision
models don't recompute kinematics.
- Blocking: efficiency, and correctness risk if the two passes diverge.
- Fix: add method to `robot_tree.py` before Phase 2.

**Q3 — AABB center at body origin, not CoM**
Current `AABBSelfCollision` uses the body frame origin as the AABB center.
If the CoM is far from the origin (offset-heavy links), the bounding box
is inaccurate.
- Current: acceptable for Phase 1 (links are roughly symmetric)
- Fix: use CoM-centered AABB, or switch to OBB. Revisit in Phase 2.

**Q4 — Contact/self-collision unification (long-term)**
Phase 1 uses explicit `ContactPoint` (discrete foot tips) for ground contact
and `BodyAABB` for self-collision — two separate geometry systems.
Phase 2+ should unify: ground contact generated from `BodyCollisionGeometry`
automatically (any geometry touching terrain → contact), not from manually
specified points.
- Blocking: nothing for Phase 2. Keep the two systems from diverging in API.
- Revisit: when implementing `TerrainPenaltyContactModel`.

## robot/ Layer

**Q5 — URDF with no `<inertial>` on a link**
Treated as point mass `1e-6 kg` at origin with a warning log.
Alternative: infer inertia from collision geometry (MuJoCo `inertiafromgeom`).
- Current decision: placeholder mass, log warning.
- Revisit: if users report unrealistic behaviour for sensor/virtual links.

**Q6 — Multiple `<collision>` elements per link**
All shapes are kept in `BodyCollisionGeometry.shapes: list[ShapeInstance]`.
Each collision algorithm decides how to merge or iterate them.
- Confirmed design, no action needed — but must verify AABB merge logic
  in `AABBSelfCollision.from_geometries()` handles multi-shape bodies correctly.

**Q7 — Mesh collision geometry (`<geometry><mesh/>`)**
`MeshShape` stores only `filename`, no geometry is loaded or processed.
- Current: silently skipped in collision model construction (logged as warning)
- Needed: convex hull or SDF baking. Phase 3.

**Q8 — Simulator (Layer 2) module location**
Where does the `Simulator` class live?
- Option A: `physics/simulator.py` (alongside algorithms)
- Option B: top-level `simulator.py` (emphasises it as the external interface)
- Not yet decided.

## rl_env / Layer 3

**Q9 — Generic obs/action space for diverse robot types**
How does `base_env.py` define observation and action spaces in a way that
works for both legged robots and manipulators?
- Isaac Lab reference: `ObservationManager` / `RewardManager` with named,
  composable terms (see REFERENCES.md).
- Not yet designed. Needed before Phase 2 rl_env implementation.

**Q11 — `<inertial><origin rpy>` 非零的处理**
URDF 允许惯量张量在任意旋转的 CoM frame 里定义（非零 rpy）。
几乎所有真实 URDF 的 inertial rpy 都是零，但规范上合法。
- 当前决策：零 rpy 正常处理；非零 rpy log warning，不报错，张量直接使用
- 待定：是否需要将张量旋转到 link frame（`I_link = R @ I_com @ R.T`）
- 参考：Pinocchio 和 Drake 都做了完整旋转变换

**Q12 — Fixed joint 合并优化（未来）**
当前每个 link 保留独立 Body，fixed joint 不合并。
若未来做合并优化（减少 ABA 计算量），需注意平行轴定理的正确应用：
`I_A = I_B + m * (|r|²·I₃ - r·rᵀ)`，其中 r 是从 A origin 到 B CoM 的向量。
Pinocchio issue #1388 曾在此处有 bug。
- 当前：不合并，无风险
- 未来：合并前必须加单元测试验证惯量变换

## Infrastructure

**Q10 — Unit tests are missing**
`tests/` is empty. Phase 1 validation was done via the drop-test example,
not automated tests. Minimum needed before Phase 2:
- `test_free_fall.py` — analytic free-fall vs ABA (already validated manually)
- `test_pendulum.py` — single pendulum energy conservation
- `test_contact.py` — contact force direction and magnitude
- `test_joint_limits.py` — penalty torque at/beyond limits
- Blocking: CI and the `/review` skill will flag missing tests for any new module.
